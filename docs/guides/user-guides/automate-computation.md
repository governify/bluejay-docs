# Automate computation 
---
First of all, navigate to [TPA Manager](development/bluejay-only-services/tpa-manager.md), then, theres a way to automate the computation of a course or project. This is done by activating the auto run feature. This feature is available for both courses and projects.

**There are two options** to make it work:
1.  **Auto run course**: Each course has a checkbox to activate the auto run feature. When this feature is activated, the course will be computed automatically.

2.  **Activate auto run project**: Each project has a activate button to activate the auto run feature. When this feature is activated, the project will be computed automatically.
