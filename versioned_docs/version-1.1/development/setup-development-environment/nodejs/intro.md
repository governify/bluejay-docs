# Nodejs Deployment

---

## Overview

In order to deploy the system locally to be able to extend the microservices and test them before generating a new version for production, there is the possibility of deploying the system completely or partially in Nodejs.

This section will explain how to deploy the complete system with NodeJS. However, it is common to only deploy the microservice that you need to expand locally. That's why a combination of deployment with Docker Compose and deployment with NodeJS is used.

## Pre-requirements

If you only want to deploy any of the microservices with NodeJS, you must have the system deployed with [Docker Compose](/development/setup-development-environment/docker-compose). Then visit the sections below to learn how to deploy each microservice independently using NodeJS and Docker Compose.

If you want to deploy the complete system with NodeJS,

- Install Visual Studio Code
- Install Node.js

and continue reading this section.
